## What are Apify Actors?

- Actors are serverless cloud programs that can perform anything from a simple action, like filling out a web form, to a complex operation, like crawling an entire website or removing duplicates from a large dataset.
- Actors are programs packaged as Docker images, which accept a well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce a well-defined JSON output.

## Do / Don't and Resources

Follow the Do/Don't guidance, input/output schema descriptions and resources in the AGENTS.md template (same guidance used for other Actor scaffolds). Respect platform ToS, rate limits, and privacy rules. Use Apify Proxy when scaling and store secrets securely.
